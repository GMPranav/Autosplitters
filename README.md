First of all, activate the autosplitter by clicking "Activate".
In the run category field type in the name of the category and subcategory you're running. It has to be exactly on of the following:

In the settings window check the splits you want for the category you're going to run. It doesn't matter if other categories settings are checked, only the relevant category is taken into account.

Your split names don't have to match the ones from the settings, but they must be the same amount and go in the same order as in the settings.  
Take note that the script only checks the current split, if you somehow skipped one then you have to skip a split manually in livesplit.

If you encounter a bug or want to have a custom split added, you can contact me in discord: Creditor#0428
